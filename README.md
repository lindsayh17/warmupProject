# Countries of The World

This dataset is Countries of the World. It includes 227 unique values, and 6 different entities. 
The entities are the country name, the region where that country is located, population of each country,
the area in square miles, the coastline to area ratio (optional), and GDP in USD per capita. 
These entities are a combination of string and integer values, with Country and Region being strings, 
and Population, GDP, Area, and Coastline having numeric values. Coastline to area ratio can be used as an 
optional value by leaving out that entity for landlocked countries. The country name is a unique identifier for the dataset.
